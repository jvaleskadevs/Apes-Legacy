# Apes Legacy 

## Enabling Inheritance of BAYC, MAYC and BAKC

 - **Apes Legacy** enables BAYC, MAYC and BAKC **inheritance**.  
 - **Rachel** wants to send all her Apes to her son when she is 60 and retire on a desert island
   with no Internet connection. Just set the date of her 60th birthday as `deadline`, the address
   of her son as `beneficiary` and... *Done!*   
 - **Alice** has a daughter. Alice wants to send her Ape to her daughter when she is 16 years old.
   Just set the daughter's address as `beneficiary` and the date of her sixteen as `deadline`. *Done!*
 - **Bob** wants to hold their Apes until the end ðŸ’Ž, then send them to his caretaker. Just set the
   caretaker's address as `beneficiary` and for the `deadline` he set January, 1st. Every December Bob
   updates the `deadline` to the next year. *Done!*
 - **David** has no descendants, but he wants to send their Apes to his nephews and nieces when they
   are 14 years old. Just choose a `tokenId` for each one, and set each `deadline` to the birthday of
   its corresponding `beneficiary`. *Done!*
 - The **mechanism** is not like the real world **inheritance.** It is *decentralized, fast, easy,
   cheap, no paperwork, no third parties, infallible, immutable, flexible, trusted...* So, **better**.
 - Also, the mechanism could be used as a way to add a secondary wallet to manage Apes for sec
   purposes, maybe a **recovery** after lost the keys for the main wallet.

## How it works

 - An **Ape holder** (BAYC, MAYC or BAKC) may set a **beneficiary** wallet address as of a **deadline** for 
   *one of their tokens* or *for all of them.*
 - The **beneficiary** will be able to **claim** the Ape(s) after reach the **deadline**.
 - The **registrant** may **change** the **beneficiary** and/or the **deadline** as many times as desired.
 - The **registrant** may change the **beneficiary** to the *zero address* or the **deadline** to zero to **cancel**
   any previous register *for tokenId* or *for all of them*.

## Technical details

 - The contract stores the **state** of the inheritance registry using 2 *mappings*. The first stores
   the `beneficiary` of a `tokenId` of an specific holder. The second stores the `deadline` in the same
   way. Both are using *MaxUint256* as `tokenId` to represent the *forAll* registry.
 - The **register/unregister flow** consists on update these *mappings*.
 - The **claim token(s) flow** consists on *transfer* the token(s) after check these *mappings*.
 - The service includes a **notification system** to help the registrants like Bob not to miss the
   extension of the claim date. This system uses the **Push protocol** and **Polybase**.
 - Yeah, I know, this is nothing complex, but that's all!.

## Price (ApeCoin)

 - Currently the service must to be paid using the **Ape Coin token**.
 - The price for **tokenId** is **3 Ape Coin**.
 - The price for **all tokens** is **10 Ape Coin**.
 - The price must to be paid only the **first time** using the service. (*for tokenId* and *forAll*)
 
 ## Push Notifications 
 
 - The registrant may set the notifications ON/OFF to start/stop receiving notifications trough the Push Protocol.
 - The registrant may set the desired days to be notified before reach the claim date. A notification will be sent daily.
 - This mechanism should help registrants to remember that they need to extend their claim date.
 - To receive the notifications the registrants should download the Push App in their smartphones.
 - The ShowRunners framework will send the notifications to the required users. To know about users and deadlines
   the framework is using the getSubscribers function and fetching data from Polybase, a decentralized database.
 - Relevant Push files are `frontend/components/NotifyComponent.jsx` and `showrunners/src/showrunners/jvaleska/*`.
 
 ## Polybase
 
 - The decentralized database is in charge of store the necessary data to manage the notifications trough the Push Protocol.
 - Polybase requires the registrant's signature to create/update/delete their data from the database. Your keys, your data.  
 - The registrant may change the number of days to be notified before reach the claim date without problem.
 - The registrant is in charge to update the claim date stored in Polybase whenever he/she changes this date in the blockchain.
 - The previous feature could be done automatically at the moment of register an Ape to the service. Separated for simplicity.
 - The registrant may delete their data from the database to stop receiving notifications in the future.
 - Relevant Polybase files are `polybase.schema`, `frontend/components/NotifyComponent.jsx` and `showrunners/src/showrunners/jvaleska/jvaleskaChannel.ts`.
